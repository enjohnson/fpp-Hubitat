# fpp-smartthings

This is a Falcon Player (fpp) plugin that allows you to control SmartThings devices by using commands in fpp.

I developed this so that I could automate the turning on/off of my tune-to sign (which is plugged into a smart plug) and turn on/off other house lights before and after the show without having to maintain separate triggers in SmartThings. 

NOTE: This currently uses the SmartThings groovy IDE, which is said to be going away sometime in 2021. When that happens this plugin will need to be updated.

## Installation
In fpp, go to Content Setup, Plugin Manager and paste the following URL in the box and click "Retrieve Plugin Info":
